;; Setup an upstream task
;; Setup two downstream peers on a dst-task-id with same task-id
;; Publications will now need to know downstream peers as well as dst-task-id so they know what heartbeats to expect.
;; Subscriptions will need to know upstream peer, but this is already known in src-peer-id

;; Upstream task starts offering barriers. 
   ;; Iterate through all the publications 
        ;; Offer a barrier in each iteration to peers that haven't replied with a ready
        ;; Send a heartbeat in each iteration to peers that haven't sent a heartbeat. This should include replica-version
   ;; Poll heartbeat channel, if you receive a heartbeat, set the publication to ready. Upon receiving either a heartbeat or a ready [replica epoch], reset heartbeat count.
   ;; For 

;; Extra peer group subscriber that can look at all the heartbeats and make an overall decision? Would also allow this to be exposed to a health endpoint more easily
